    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). It is the process of hiding unnecessary details and only showing the essential features of an object to the user. In other words, abstraction is the process of focusing on the essential qualities of an object while ignoring its non-essential details.\n",

Instead, we only need to know how to operate the steering wheel, brakes, and accelerator pedal to drive the car. This is an example of abstraction. The user is only concerned with the essential features of the car, while the non-essential details are hidden from them."
